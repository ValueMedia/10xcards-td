# Rules for AI

This file provides guidance to AI Agent when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- `npm run dev` — start dev server (Cloudflare workerd runtime)
- `npm run build` — production build (SSR via `@astrojs/cloudflare`)
- `npm run preview` — preview production build
- `npm run lint` — ESLint with type-checked rules
- `npm run lint:fix` — auto-fix lint issues
- `npm run format` — Prettier (includes prettier-plugin-astro + prettier-plugin-tailwindcss)

Pre-commit hooks: husky + lint-staged runs `eslint --fix` on `*.{ts,tsx,astro}` and `prettier --write` on `*.{json,css,md}`.

## Architecture

**Astro 6 SSR app** with React 19 islands, Tailwind 4, Supabase auth, and shadcn/ui components. Deployed to Cloudflare Workers.

### Rendering mode

Full server-side rendering (`output: "server"` in astro.config.mjs). All pages are server-rendered by default. API routes must export `const prerender = false`.

### Auth flow

- `src/lib/supabase.ts` — creates a Supabase SSR client using `@supabase/ssr` with cookie-based sessions. Uses `astro:env/server` for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` (server-only secrets declared in astro.config.mjs `env.schema`).
- `src/middleware.ts` — runs on every request, resolves the current user, attaches to `context.locals.user`. Redirects unauthenticated users away from routes listed in `PROTECTED_ROUTES`.
- API endpoints: `src/pages/api/auth/{signin,signup,signout}.ts`
- Auth pages: `src/pages/auth/{signin,signup,confirm-email}.astro`
- Protected page example: `src/pages/dashboard.astro`

### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/*` maps to `./src/*` (tsconfig paths).
- **Astro components** for static content/layout; **React components** only when interactivity is needed.
- **Tailwind class merging**: use the `cn()` helper from `@/lib/utils` (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional/merged class names. Do not concatenate class strings manually.
- **shadcn/ui**: components live in `src/components/ui/`, "new-york" style variant. Install new ones with `npx shadcn@latest add [name]`.
- **API routes**: use uppercase `GET`, `POST` exports; validate input with zod.
- **Supabase migrations**: `supabase/migrations/` using naming format `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_short_description.sql`. Always enable RLS on new tables with granular per-operation, per-role policies.
- **React**: no Next.js directives ("use client" etc.). Extract hooks to `src/components/hooks/`.
- **Services/helpers** go in `src/lib/` (or `src/lib/services/` for extracted business logic).
- **Shared types** (entities, DTOs) go in `src/types.ts`.

### Environment

- Node.js v22.14.0 (see `.nvmrc`)
- Env vars: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_KEY` (copy `.env.example` to `.env` for Node, or `.dev.vars` for Cloudflare local dev)
- Local Supabase: `npx supabase start` (requires Docker)
- Cloudflare local dev: secrets go in `.dev.vars` (gitignored)
- Deploy: `npx wrangler deploy` (requires Cloudflare account + `wrangler` auth)

## CI

Two independent mechanisms gate this repo. They are separate — a GitHub Actions status check does **not** gate the Cloudflare deploy (see below).

- **GitHub Actions floor (pre-push feedback).** The workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `npm run lint`, `npm test` (the deterministic node+workers floor, 87 tests, no external services), and `npm run build` on every push and PR to `main`. Requires `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_KEY` repository secrets for the build step. A red unit/component/worker test turns the workflow red. This is fast feedback; it does **not** deploy and does **not** gate the Cloudflare deploy.
- **Cloudflare production gate (blocks a red deploy).** Cloudflare auto-deploys whatever lands on `main` via its own dashboard↔GitHub Git integration (production branch `main`). Under this repo's direct-push flow, the real production gate is the Cloudflare build command, set in the dashboard (Workers → `10xcards-td` → Settings → Build) to **`npm test && npm run build`**. A red `npm test` fails the build, so no new version ships (the deploy command `npx wrangler deploy` never runs). No `npm ci` prefix because Workers Builds auto-installs dependencies before the build command. The command lives in the dashboard (outside version control); it is recorded here so it is a known fact. `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` build env is already wired for `npm run build`; node+workers tests need no extra secrets. (Previous build command, for rollback: `npm run build`.)

The integration suite (`npm run test:integration -- --no-file-parallelism`) is a deliberate **local-only** gate (requires local Supabase + service-role key) and runs in neither mechanism by decision — see `context/foundation/test-plan.md` §5/§6.6.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 2

Turn one roadmap item into the first implementation cycle with the **change planning chain**:

```
/10x-roadmap -> /10x-new -> /10x-plan -> /10x-plan-review -> /10x-implement
```

`/10x-new`, `/10x-plan`, `/10x-plan-review`, and `/10x-implement` are the lesson focus. `/10x-frame` and `/10x-research` are not required rituals here; they are escalation paths introduced in the next lesson.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill                                  | Use it when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Change setup (lesson focus)**        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-new <change-id>`                 | You selected a roadmap item and need a stable change folder. Creates `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` so planning, implementation, progress, commits, and later review all share one identity. Use AFTER roadmap selection, BEFORE `/10x-plan`.               |
| **Planning (lesson focus)**            |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-plan <change-id>`                | You have a change folder and need a reviewable implementation plan. Reads roadmap context, foundation docs, codebase evidence, and any existing change notes; writes `plan.md` and `plan-brief.md` with phases, file contracts, success criteria, and `## Progress`. |
| **Plan readiness (lesson focus)**      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-plan-review <change-id>`         | You have `plan.md` and need a light pre-code readiness check. Use it to catch missing end state, weak contracts, malformed progress, scope drift, or blind spots before code changes begin.                                                                          |
| **Implementation (lesson focus)**      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>` | You have an approved plan and want to execute one phase with verification, manual gate, commit ritual, and SHA write-back to `## Progress`.                                                                                                                          |
| **Lifecycle closure**                  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `/10x-archive <change-id>`             | A change is merged or intentionally closed. Move it out of active `context/changes/` into archive state.                                                                                                                                                             |

### How the chain hands off

- `/10x-new` creates the durable change identity.
- `/10x-plan` turns that identity into an implementation contract.
- `/10x-plan-review` checks the plan before the agent mutates code.
- `/10x-implement` executes one planned phase, verifies, asks for manual confirmation when needed, commits, and records progress.

### Lesson boundaries

- Plan is the default router after roadmap selection. Start with `/10x-plan` unless the problem is unclear or external evidence is blocking.
- Do not run `/10x-frame + /10x-research` as ceremony for every change.
- Do not turn this lesson into a full end-to-end product build. A checkpoint with a planned and partially or fully implemented stream is valid.
- Code review of the implemented diff belongs to Lesson 3 via `/10x-impl-review`.
- Lifecycle closure via `/10x-archive` after a change is merged or intentionally closed.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/foundation/roadmap.md` - upstream roadmap
- `context/changes/<change-id>/change.md` - change identity
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation contract
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan-brief.md` - compressed handoff
- `context/foundation/lessons.md` - recurring rules and pitfalls
- `docs/reference/contract-surfaces.md` - load-bearing names registry

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
